/**
 * Callback interface for servers. You can supply an implementation of this to receive notification
 * messages from the server.
 * If an added callback ever throws an exception or goes away, it will be automatically removed.
 * Please note that all callbacks are done asynchronously; murmur does not wait for the callback to
 * complete before continuing processing.
 * Note that callbacks are removed when a server is stopped, so you should have a callback for
 * {@link MetaCallback.started} which calls {@link Server.addCallback}.
 * @see MetaCallback
 * @see Server.addCallback
